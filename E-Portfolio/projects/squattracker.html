      <h2> About the Squat Tracker!</h2>
      <p>
        The Squat Form Tracker represents a culmination of cutting-edge technology and meticulous engineering, aimed at revolutionizing the fitness industry.
        Leveraging the power of OpenCV for computer vision, this system meticulously analyzes and assesses the form of individuals performing squats, providing real-time feedback to enhance their workout experience.
        By utilizing advanced algorithms and image processing techniques, the tracker can accurately detect and evaluate key aspects of squatting technique, such as posture, depth, and alignment, allowing users to make immediate adjustments for optimal performance and injury prevention.
      </p>
      <p>
        The integration of Raspberry Pi into the development process has been instrumental in creating a functional minimum viable product (MVP) that is both compact and versatile.
        This miniature computer serves as the brain of the tracker, processing data from the OpenCV module and delivering visual and audio feedback in real time.
        The Raspberry Pi's capabilities in data processing and connectivity make it an ideal platform for this project, ensuring seamless operation and ease of use for fitness enthusiasts looking to improve their squatting technique effectively.
